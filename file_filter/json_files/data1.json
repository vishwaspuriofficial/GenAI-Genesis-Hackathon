It  will  cover  the  logistics  of  the  event  in  addition  to  what  participants  can  expect  to  get  out  of  it.   \nGeneral  Guidelines IEEE  UofT  Student  Branch  is  the  organization  hosting  MakeUofT,  and  we  believe  in  the  creativity  of  our  participants.  MakeUofT  is  a  24-hour,  300-maker,  open  design  challenge  with  the  theme  of  Sustainability  and  Green  Tech,  Wearable  Technology  and  Video  Games !  Teams  will  have  the  freedom  to  design  and  implement  whatever  they  want,  from  innovative  solutions  for  everyday  issues  to  novel  gadgets  that  push  the  boundaries  of  existing  designs.  You  are  welcome  to  bring  your  own  hardware  components,  or  you  may  use  those  provided  by  us.    Each  team  will  be  submitting  to  the  Best  Overall  prize  category  (1st,  2nd,  3rd  place  prizes)  through  Devpost.  Additionally,  each  team  can  choose  to  submit  to  additional  prize  categories  also  found  on  Devpost.  During  the  showcase,  each  group  will  have  around  5  minutes  to  present  and  demo  their  project.  Participants  are  welcome  to  view  other  teams\u2019  demos  outside  of  their  own  presentation  time.   For  determining  overall  1st,  2nd,  and  3rd  place,  your  team\u2019s  \ufb01nal  design  will  be  evaluated  based  on  the  following  categories:  Idea  Originality,  Technical  Complexity,  Working  Demonstration  and  Presentation.  Check  out  Devpost  for  more  info.  \nAdditional  Resources  3D  printing  will  be  managed  by  MakeUofT  staff  to  maximize  ef\ufb01ciency  and  fairness,  as  well  as  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  printers  on  loan  to  us.  In  most  cases,  printing  will  be  standardized  at  0.3  mm  layer  height  using  PLA.",
