The\\nedge set E is constructed by connecting pairs of pixels\\nthat are neighbors in an 8-connected sense (any other\\nlocal neighborhood could be used). This yields a graph\\nwherem = O(n), so the running time of the segmenta-\\ntion algorithm is O(n log n) for n image pixels. We use\\nan edge weight function based on the absolute intensity\\ndifference between the pixels connected by an edge,\\nw(vi ,v j ) =| I (pi ) − I (pj )|\\nwhere I (pi )i s the intensity of the pixelpi .I n general we\\nuse a Gaussian ﬁlter to smooth the image slightly before\\ncomputing the edge weights, in order to compensate for\\ndigitization artifacts. We always use a Gaussian with\\nσ= 0.8, which does not produce any visible change\\nto the image but helps remove artifacts.\\nFor color images we run the algorithm three times,\\nonce for each of the red, green and blue color planes,\\nand then intersect these three sets of components.\\nSpeciﬁcally, we put two neighboring pixels in the same\\ncomponent when they appear in the same component in\\nall three of the color plane segmentations. Alternatively\\none could run the algorithm just once on a graph where\\nthe edge weights measure the distance between pixels\\nin some color space, however experimentally we ob-\\ntained better results by intersecting the segmentations\\nfor each color plane in the manner just described.\\nThere is one runtime parameter for the algorithm,\\nwhich is the value of k that is used to compute\\nthe threshold function τ. Recall we use the function\\nτ(C) = k/|C| where |C| is the number of elements\\nin C. Thus k effectively sets a scale of observation, in\\nthat a larger k causes a preference for larger compo-\\nnents. We use two different parameter settings for the\\nexamples in this section (and throughout the paper),\\ndepending on the resolution of the image and the de-\\ngree to which ﬁne detail is important in the scene.

The computation ofMInt can be done in constant\\ntime per edge if we knowInt and the size of each com-\\nponent. MaintainingInt for a component can be done in\\nconstant time for each merge, as the maximum weight\\nedge in the MST of a component is simply the edge\\ncausing the merge.
