## Inspiration

In today's fast-paced work environment, inefficient meetings consume valuable time and resources, leading to reduced productivity and increased costs. This solution aims to streamline the meeting process by leveraging AI to reduce unnecessary discussions, ensuring better-prepared sessions and more effective collaboration.

## What it does

Request Team Agent: Users can request a meeting with a team agent through the platform.

Booking Appointments: The system facilitates scheduling appointments with the requested team agent.

Pre-Meeting Preparation:

The requested team receives the meeting questions in advance, allowing them to prepare effectively.

They can upload relevant documents, which the AI agent uses for training.

During the meeting, the AI agent can assist by providing answers and insights based on the uploaded notes, ensuring a productive session.

## How we built it

**Gemini AI**: Used for natural language processing and document comprehension.

**Streamlit**: Built the user interface, providing an interactive and user-friendly web experience.

**Flask**: Backend framework handling the meeting requests, booking logic, and AI training pipeline integration.

## Challenges we ran into

Complex Integration: Merging the AI agent, booking system, and document processing pipeline posed a challenge, requiring efficient data flow and synchronization.

Real-Time AI Training: Training the AI on uploaded documents dynamically before the meeting required efficient data handling and processing.

Scalability: Ensuring the system could handle multiple simultaneous meeting requests without performance issues.
